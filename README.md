attempt at a Java raytracer

This is my first raytracer. I'm just writing this in my free time, when I'm not busy with schoolwork. I'm using to teach myself the usual raytracing techniques through the internet and various books and papers.

Features:
- Geometric primitives (spheres, planes, cylinders)
- OBJ models
- Diffuse and reflective materials
- indirect and direct lighting
- area and point light sources
- multithreading
- saving to .png's
- hardcoded scenes
